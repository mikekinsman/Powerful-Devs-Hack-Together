üõ†Ô∏è Build, innovate, and #Hacktogether! üõ†Ô∏è

It's time to start developing secure solutions at enterprise scale using the power of AI and the Power Platform! ü§ñ + üìö = üî•

The Power Platform (Power Apps, Copilot Studio, Power Automate, and Power Pages) are powerful tools to help any maker build any app, flow, site or agent they need, but how can professional developers get the most out of what the Power Platform has to offer? 
Through the Powerful Devs Conference and corresponding Hack Together, you will learn about ways you can use the Power Platform to enhance your productivity as a professional developer. Through these sessions, you'll learn about using gen AI in Copilot Studio, Managed Identities in Dataverse, how to extend your solutions as a developer by using external connectors using Visual Studio Code, and so much more. 
The Powerful Devs: Hack Together is your opportunity to apply what you've learned and build a solution yourself, using all the new tools in your toolkit. Across 14 sessions in both the conference and hackathon, you will learn all about how to be a Powerful Developer by using the Power Platform. The possibilities are endless for what you can create... plus you can submit your hack for a chance to win exciting prizes! ü•≥

The conference is on February 12th and the corresponding hackathon runs from February 13th to February 28th. Hack submissions are due February 28th, 11:59 PM PST. Join us!
